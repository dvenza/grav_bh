## Up-to-date documentation

I'm updating and integrating the userspace API documentation of Socket-CAN, taking the original documents written in German and LaTeX, translating them and contributing patches to the text files distributed with the Linux kernel.

This page is intended to present all information pertaining to this project.

All this work happened when SocketCAN was still hosted at BerliOS. Unfortunately the SVN history has been lost and nothing remains in the main Linux kernel GIT.

The original documentation was at http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/socketcan/trunk/doc/socketcan.md

### Current documentation

* [Kernel can.txt](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/networking/can.txt)
